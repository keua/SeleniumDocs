# NightwatchJS

> Is a NodeJS based framework that uses the Selenium webdriver to do the tests.

## Theory of operation

> Nightwatch works by communicating over a restful HTTP api with a WebDriver server (typically the Selenium server). The restful API protocol is defined by the W3C WebDriver API. See below for an example workflow for browser initialization.
